        <p>
          I am <strong>22 years old</strong> and I am from Uruguay. I have 2 younger sisters, Lucia and Sofia. I love fashion, makeup 💋 and travelling 🌎. Since I was a little girl I practiced ballet 💃 and I played tennis 🎾. I lived my whole life in the same city, Montevideo, so moving to <code><strong>France 🇫🇷 </code></strong> was a big adventure that just started 🤩!

        <h2>Hobbies ✨</h2>
        <p>
          In my free time my favorite thing to do is <strong> spend time with my friends</strong>. I love going to restaurants, visit new places, watch movies and shopping. When I go to the restaurants I love to order sushi 🍣 and burgers🍔. My favourite places to go shopping are Zara and Subdued 👗.As a travel lover, I discover more than 20 countries, my favorite ones in Europe were Switzerland because of its mountains and cities and also italy because of its beautiful beaches🏖️ and history. In America my favorite country was USA, specially New York with its beautiful lights and life and Orlando thanks to the amazing thematic parks🎢.
